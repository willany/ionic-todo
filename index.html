          <p>Welcome
This is a mobile application that helps in our daily lives, creating a list of activities and marking them as complete or not.</p>

<p>Built from the Ionic Framework, Ionic is the beautiful, open source front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with web technologies. Free and open source, Ionic offers a library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS CSS components, gestures, and tools for building highly interactive apps. Built with Sass and optimized for AngularJS.</p>

<p>A match made in heaven. Ionic utilizes Angular in order to create a powerful SDK most suited to develop rich and robust applications. Ionic not only looks nice, but its core architecture is built for serious app development, and Angular ties in perfectly.</p>

<p>Clean, simple, and functional. Ionic has been designed to work and display beautifully on all current mobile devices. With tons of popular mobile components, typography, interactive paradigms, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme, you'll wonder how you lived without it.</p>
